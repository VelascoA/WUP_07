### Data is from the Patient_Info dataset from South Korea 1 Jan to 1 May 
### This is contained in a downloadable zip file from kaggle

Some of the data was uncoded for sex - sex must be just male or female
77 of the data entries were coded sex  as blank, so we omit these.
state of a patient must be died or alive - we adjust that as well   
  
# Question 1 - Is dying independent of sex

$H_0$ There is no correlation are between sex and dying

$H_A$ There is correlation between sex and dying  


Table of patients:
```{r}

# cross tabulation, patient state by gender

with(kRdata, table(Sex, result))

```




## We create two bar charts - one based on frequency and the other on percent, use ggplot commands to do this


```{r}
dd2 <- kRdata %>% group_by(result,Sex) %>% summarize(count=n()) %>% mutate(prcnt=count/sum(count))


# the group_by followed by summarize(count=n())

basicC <- ggplot(dd2,aes(x=result,y=count,fill=Sex))
basicC + geom_bar(stat="identity",position="dodge")

#Now for percentage plot

basicCC <- ggplot(dd2,aes(x=result,y=prcnt*100,fill=Sex)) 
basicCC + geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge")
```

From the data it can be seen that more men die from COVID-19 than women do. About 65% of men die where as 38% of females die. Where around 55% or women live and around 42% of men live through COVID-19. 

  
## Numerical results

```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~result + Sex, data=kRdata)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```

The numerical data shows males are twice as likely to die than their female counter parts. Showing only 1.4% of females died where as 3% of males died.  

## Inferential results 

```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
fisher.test(table1)
```

The fisher test shows men are 2.3 times more likely to die than females in this study. It also gives us a p-value of 0.0009 showing the slim chances of such a result if there was no difference.  

## Conclusions
